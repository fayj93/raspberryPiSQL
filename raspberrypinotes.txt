STEP ONE
    http://raspberrywebserver.com/sql-databases/
    1) $ Install sqllite
        $ sudo apt-get install sqlite3

    2)The SQLite libraries are supplied with an SQLite shell. Use this command to invoke the shell and create a database:
        $ sqlite3 mydatabase.db

    3) The file mydatabase.db doesn't exist yet. It will be created when I commit changes
    to the database. After typing the command above, a prompt appears where I can enter
    commands. The shell supports two types of commands. Commands that start with a '.'
    are used to control the shell. Try typing these commands:
      sqlite> .help
      sqlite> .show
        INFO- http://raspberrywebserver.com/sql-databases/

    4) Using SQL to access databases
        -Structured Query Language (SQL) is a language that's used for interacting with databases.
        It can be used to create tables, insert data and search for data. SQL works with different
        database solutions such as SQLite, MySQL, Oracle and others. SQL statements must have a ';' on the end.
        It's common for SQL commands to be capitalized, but this isn't striclty necessary. Some people argue that
         using capitals increases readability because it's easier to distinguish between SQL commands and everything else.


        - storing images as BLOB data type
                https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/how-to-export-a-sqlite-blob-field-containing-a-jpg-file-as-part-of-a-text-file.27634/


         -create a simple database that could be used for logging temperatures in different parts of a home. The first thing
         to do is create a table:
          BEGIN;
          CREATE TABLE images (tdate DATE, ttime TIME, title TEXT, picfile BINARY);
          COMMIT;

                  This creates a table with columns labelled tdate, ttime, zone and temperature. Their
               respective types are DATE, TIME, TEXT and NUMERIC. Don't forget the semi-colons at the
               end of each line. Next we need to add some data:
          BEGIN;
          INSERT INTO images values(date('now', '-1 day'), time('now'), "imageONE", );
          INSERT INTO images values(date('now', '-1 day'), time('now'), "imageTWO", );
          INSERT INTO images values(date('now', '-1 day'), time('now'), "imageTHREE", );
          INSERT INTO images values(date('now'), time('now', '-12 hours'), "imageFOUR", );
          INSERT INTO images values(date('now'), time('now', '-12 hours'), "imageFIVE", );
          INSERT INTO images values(date('now'), time('now', '-12 hours'), "imageSIX", );
          INSERT INTO images values(date('now'), time('now'), "imageSEVEN", );
          INSERT INTO images values(date('now'), time('now'), "imageEIGHT", );
          INSERT INTO images values(date('now'), time('now'), "imageNINE", );
          COMMIT;
